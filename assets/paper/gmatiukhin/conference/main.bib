  abstract = {The original formulation of SharedPlans by B. Grosz and C. Sidner
              (1990) was developed to provide a model of collaborative planning
              in which it was not necessary for one agent to have intentions-to
              toward an act of a different agent. Unlike other contemporaneous
              approaches (J.R. Searle, 1990), this formulation provided for two
              agents to coordinate their activities without introducing any
              notion of irreducible joint intentions. However, it only treated
              activities that directly decomposed into single-agent actions, did
              not address the need for agents to commit to their joint activity,
              and did not adequately deal with agents having only partial
              knowledge of the way in which to perform an action. This paper
              provides a revised and expanded version of SharedPlans that
              addresses these shortcomings. It also reformulates Pollack's (1990)
              definition of individual plans to handle cases in which a single
              agent has only partial knowledge; this reformulation meshes with
              the definition of SharedPlans. The new definitions also allow for
              contracting out certain actions. The formalization that results has
              the features required by Bratman's (1992) account of shared
              cooperative activity and is more general than alternative accounts
              (H. Levesque et al., 1990; E. Sonenberg et al., 1992).},

  abstract = {Consider an intelligent agent constructing a plan to be executed
              by several other agents; correct plan execution will often require
              that actions be taken in a specific sequence. Therefore, the
              planner cannot simply tell each agent what action to perform;
              explicit mechanisms must exist for maintaining the execution
              sequence. This paper outlines such mechanisms. A framework for
              multiple-agent planning is developed, consisting of several parts.
              First, a formalism is adopted for representing knowledge about
              other agents' beliefs and goals, and is extended to allow
              representation of their capabilities. Communication primitives are
              defined that allow selective acceptance of goals and facts, and an
              explicit means of inducing an agent to perform an act is
              introduced. Finally, the ordering mechanisms (consisting of
              sequencing operators and a planning heuristic) arc presented, along

              activities should be coordinated so that they cooperate coherently.
              Coherence is particularly problematic in domains where each agent
              has only a limited view of the overall task, where communication
              between agents is limited, and where there is no “controller” to
              coordinate the agents. Our approach to coherent cooperation in such
              domains is developed in the context of a distributed
              problem-solving network where agents cooperate to solve a single
              problem. The approach stresses the importance of sophisticated
              local control by which each problem-solving node integrates
              knowledge of the problem domain with (meta-level) knowledge about
              network coordination. This allows nodes to make rapid, intelligent
              local decisions based on changing problem characteristics with only
              a limited amount of intercommunication to coordinate these
              decisions. We describe three mechanisms that improve network
              coherence: 1) an organizational structure that provides a long-term
              framework for network coordination to guide each node's local
              control decisions; 2) a planner at each node that develops
              sequences of problem-solving activities based on the current
              situation; and 3) meta-level communication about the current state
              of local problem solving that enables nodes to dynamically refine
              the organization. We present a variety of problem-solving
              situations to show the benefits and limitations of these mechanisms
              , and we provide simulation results showing the mechanisms to be
              particularly cost effective in more complex problem-solving
              situations. We also discuss how these mechanisms might be of more
              general use in other distributed computing applications.},

              methods that aim at finding conflict-free paths for more than one
              agent. In many real-life applications it is possible that a
              multi-agent plan cannot be fully executed due to some changes in
              the environment (represented as a graph), or in missions in which
              the agents are involved. Even in the case of a minor change, the
              offline planning algorithm must be re-started from scratch to
              generate a new plan, and this often requires a substantial amount
              of time. Motivated by this real-life requirement, we introduced the
              Incremental Multi-Agent Path Finding (I-MAPF) problem. Any location
              (node) in the initial environment (graph) can become unavailable
              for some time and then become available again. Agents can be
              informed about these changes before they occur and some agents have
              to update their plans if they planned to use that location. The
              Conflict Based Search (CBS) is one of most the successful
              algorithms in solving MAPF problems. To our best knowledge, there
              are no currently existing studies that attempt at solving the
              I-MAPF problem. In this paper, we propose a new method to solve the
              I-MAPF problem, called CBS-D*-lite. CBS-D*-lite is built upon CBS
              and avoids re-planning for agents that are not affected by the
              environmental changes. To achieve this, CBS-D*-lite employs D*-lite
              , an incremental single-agent path-finding algorithm as the
              lower-level search method in CBS. We show that the number of
              time-steps required to solve a problem is generally lower than with
              regular CBS. Empirically, we show that the CBS-D*-lite provided
              faster results than regular CBS, and the total cost provided
              CBS-D*-lite is generally close to the total cost values provided by
              the regular CBS when there are environmental changes.},

              deterministic conformant planning. cpces solves the problem by
              producing candidate plans based on a sample of the initial belief
              state, searching for counter-examples to these plans, and assigning
              these counter-examples to the sample, until a valid plan has been
              produced or the problem has been proved unfeasible. On top of
              providing a means to compute a conformant plan, the sample can also
              be understood as a justification for the plan being found, or
              relevant reasons why a plan cannot be found. We study the
              theoretical properties that cpces enjoys—correctness, completeness,
              and optimality—and how the several variants of cpces we describe
              differ in behaviour. Moreover, we establish a theoretical
              connection between the cpces framework and well-known concepts from
              the literature such as tags and width. With this connection we
              prove the worst case complexity for some variants of cpces. Finally
              , we show how cpces can be used in a more incremental fashion by
              learning sequencing of actions from the previous plan being found.
              Such a technique mimics the use of macro-operators, widely used in
              automated planning to speedup resolution. Our theoretical analysis
              is accompanied with a thorough experimental evaluation of the
              (many) possible incarnations of cpces. This not only proves our
              theoretical findings from an empirical perspective, but also shows
              that cpces is able to handle problems that have been traditionally
              hard to solve by the existing conformant planners, whilst remaining
              competitive over “easier” conformant planning problems. Importantly
              , cpces is able to prove many unsolvable conformant planning
              problems as such, extending substantially the reach of conformant
              planners.},

              overcome the high computational complexity of solving such problems
              offline. The key challenges in decentralized operation are to
              maintain coordinated behavior with little or no communication and,
              when communication is allowed, to optimize value with minimal
              communication. The algorithm addresses these challenges by
              generating identical conditional plans based on common knowledge
              and communicating only when history inconsistency is detected,
              allowing communication to be postponed when necessary. To be
              suitable for online operation, the algorithm computes good local
              policies using a new and fast local search method implemented using
              linear programming. Moreover, it bounds the amount of memory used
              at each step and can be applied to problems with arbitrary
              horizons. The experimental results confirm that the algorithm can
              solve problems that are too large for the best existing offline

              producing much higher value with much less communication in most

              of agents each with respective start and goal positions. The task
              is to find paths for all agents while avoiding collisions. Most
              previous work on solving this problem optimally has treated the
              individual agents as a single ‘joint agent’ and then applied
              single-agent search variants of the A* algorithm. In this paper we
              present the Conflict Based Search (CBS) a new optimal multi-agent
              pathfinding algorithm. CBS is a two-level algorithm that does not
              convert the problem into the single ‘joint agent’ model. At the
              high level, a search is performed on a Conflict Tree (CT) which is
              a tree based on conflicts between individual agents. Each node in
              the CT represents a set of constraints on the motion of the agents.
              At the low level, fast single-agent searches are performed to
              satisfy the constraints imposed by the high level CT node. In many
              cases this two-level formulation enables CBS to examine fewer
              states than A* while still maintaining optimality. We analyze CBS
              and show its benefits and drawbacks. Additionally we present the
              Meta-Agent CBS (MA-CBS) algorithm. MA-CBS is a generalization of
              CBS. Unlike basic CBS, MA-CBS is not restricted to single-agent
              searches at the low level. Instead, MA-CBS allows agents to be
              merged into small groups of joint agents. This mitigates some of
              the drawbacks of basic CBS and further improves performance. In
              fact, MA-CBS is a framework that can be built on top of any optimal
              and complete MAPF solver in order to enhance its performance.
              Experimental results on various problems show a speedup of up to an
              order of magnitude over previous approaches.},

              planning, factory process planning, military mission planning and
              high-level planning for robots. Multi-agent planning aims at
              solving similar problems in the presence of multiple independent
              entities (agents). Even though such entities might want to
              cooperate in order to fulfill a common goal, they may want to keep
              their internal information and processes private. In such case, we
              talk about privacy-preserving multi-agent planning. So far,
              multi-agent planners based on heuristic search used either a local
              heuristic estimating the particular agent's local subproblem or a
              distributed heuristic estimating the global problem as a whole. In
              this paper, we present the Multi-Agent Distributed and Local
              Asynchronous (MADLA) Planner, running a novel variant of a
              distributed state-space forward-chaining multi-heuristic search
              which combines the use of a local and a distributed heuristic in
              order to combine their benefits. In particular, the planner uses
              two variants of the well known Fast-Forward heuristic. We provide
              proofs of soundness and completeness of the search algorithm and
              show how much and what type of privacy it preserves. We also
              provide an improved privacy-preserving distribution scheme for the
              Fast-Forward heuristic. We experimentally compare the newly
              proposed multi-heuristic scheme and the two used heuristics
              separately. The results show that the proposed solution outperforms
              classical (single-heuristic) distributed search with either one of
              the heuristics used separately. In the detailed experimental
              analysis, we show limits of the planner and of the used heuristics
              based on particular properties of the benchmark domains. In a
              comprehensive set of multi-agent planning domains and problems, we
              show that the MADLA Planner outperforms all contemporary
              state-of-the-art privacy-preserving multi-agent planners using a

              cooperative multi-agent environments where agents are endowed with
              planning and argumentation capabilities. Planning allows agents to
              contribute with actions to the construction of the plan, and
              argumentation is the mechanism that agents use to defend or attack
              the planning choices according to their beliefs. We present the
              formalization of the model and we provide a novel specification of
              the qualification problem. The multi-agent planning system, which
              is designed to be domain-independent, is evaluated with two
              planning tasks from the problem suites of the International
              Planning Competition. We compare our system with a
              non-argumentative planning framework and with a different approach
              of planning and argumentation. The results will show that our

              a set of tasks. Our strategy formulates the task planning problem
              as a potential game and uses decentralized stochastic sampling
              policies to reach a consensus on which sequences of actions agents
              should take. We execute this over a receding finite time horizon
              and take special care to discourage agents from breaking promises
              in the near future, which may cause other agents to unsuccessfully
              attempt a joint action. At the same time, we allow agents to change
              plans in the distant future, as this gives time for other agents to
              adapt their plans, allowing the team to escape locally optimal
              solutions. To do this we introduce two sampling schemes for new
              actions: a geometric-based scheme, where the probability of
              sampling a new action increases geometrically in time, and an
              inference-based sampling scheme, where a convolutional neural
              network provides recommendations for joint actions. We test the

              tasks by invoking corresponding services identified at execution
              time and ordered according to a graph that captures the workflow
              execution rules and data dependencies. The technology is mature and
              is used across the Internet to support a wide range of business
              transactions by taking advantage of a relatively stable
              communication and service infrastructure. This paper extends the
              applicability of workflow technology by considering settings in
              which service availability is highly variable due to the mobility
              of people and devices and due to frequent and extended
              disconnections from the wired infrastructure. This paper extends
              workflow technology to support goal-directed coordination among
              physically mobile people and devices that form a transient
              community over a mobile ad hoc network (MANET). Our approach is
              based on the notion of open workflows, i.e., workflows that are
              constructed dynamically using available knowledge and services.
              Because the workflow construction and execution are situation aware
              , different workflows are built under different circumstances even
              when the need being addressed is unchanged. We also introduce a
              framework that co-designs workflow allocation and host scheduling
              in a unified way, which can handle communication range limitations
              in a mobile environment while previous methods cannot. Specifically
              , we transform the collaboration problem into a temporal planning
              model and then solve it using automated planners. We integrate this
              framework into the CiAN workflow management system, which was
              developed in our previous work. Results of experiments we have
              conducted show that our approach significantly broadens the scope
              of previous research by solving the challenges of availability,
              mobility, and communication constraints in MANET domains.},

              but must involve the use of concepts found in organizational
              engineering as well. It is possible to establish different types of
              agent organizations according to the type of communication, the
              coordination among agents, and the type of agents that comprise the
              group. Each organization needs to be supported by a coordinated
              effort that explicitly determines how the agents should be
              organized and carry out the actions and tasks assigned to them.
              This research presents a new global coordination model for an agent
              organization. The primary novelty of the model consists of the
              dynamic and adaptive planning capability to distribute tasks among
              the agent members of the organization as effectively as possible.
              This model is unique in its conception, allowing an organization in
              a highly dynamic environment to employ self-adaptive capabilities
              in execution time. This allows for the behavior of an agent to be
              determined by the goals it wishes to reach, while still giving
              consideration to the goals of other agents and any changes in the
              environment. The model is evaluated in a multi-agent system

              planning problems by teams of cooperative agents requires
              significant coordination and communication efforts. For systems
              facing a plan failure in a dynamic environment, arguably, attempts
              to repair the failed plan in general, and especially in the
              worst-case scenarios, do not straightforwardly bring any benefit in
              terms of time complexity. However, in multi-agent settings, the
              communication complexity might be of a much higher importance,
              possibly a high communication overhead might be even prohibitive in
              certain domains. We hypothesize that in decentralized systems,
              where frequent coordination is required to achieve joint objectives
              , attempts to repair failed multi-agent plans should lead to lower
              communication overhead than replanning from scratch. Here, we

              may be conducted to determine the value and probable scope of a
              full systematic review, they may also be undertaken as exercises in
              and of themselves to summarize and disseminate research findings,
              to identify research gaps, and to make recommendations for the
              future research. This article briefly introduces the reader to
              scoping reviews, how they are different to systematic reviews, and
              why they might be conducted. The methodology and guidance for the
              conduct of systematic scoping reviews outlined below was developed
              by members of the Joanna Briggs Institute and members of five
              Joanna Briggs Collaborating Centres.",
