  abstract = {We introduce a new approach to planning in STRIPS-like domains
              based on constructing and analyzing a compact structure we call a
              planning graph. We describe a new planner, Graphplan, that uses
              this paradigm. Graphplan always returns a shortest possible
              partial-order plan, or states that no valid plan exists. We provide
              empirical evidence in favor of this approach, showing that
              Graphplan outperforms the total-order planner, Prodigy and the
              partial-order planner, UCPOP, on a variety of interesting natural
              and artificial planning problems. We also give empirical evidence
              that the plans produced by Graphplan are quite sensible. Since
              searches made by this approach are fundamentally different from the
              searches of other common planning methods, they provide a new
              perspective on the planning problem.},
