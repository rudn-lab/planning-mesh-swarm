    abstract =  {This document specifies an extension of OSPFv3 to support mobile ad hoc networks (MANETs). The extension, called OSPF-MDR, is designed as a new OSPF interface type for MANETs. OSPF-MDR is based on the selection of a subset of MANET routers, consisting of MANET Designated Routers (MDRs) and Backup MDRs. The MDRs form a connected dominating set (CDS), and the MDRs and Backup MDRs together form a biconnected CDS for robustness. This CDS is exploited in two ways. First, to reduce flooding overhead, an optimized flooding procedure is used in which only (Backup) MDRs flood new link state advertisements (LSAs) back out the receiving interface; reliable flooding is ensured by retransmitting LSAs along adjacencies. Second, adjacencies are formed only between (Backup) MDRs and a subset of their neighbors, allowing for much better scaling in dense networks. The CDS is constructed using 2-hop neighbor information provided in a Hello protocol extension. The Hello protocol is further optimized by allowing differential Hellos that report only changes in neighbor states. Options are specified for originating router-LSAs that provide full or partial topology information, allowing overhead to be reduced by advertising less topology information. This memo defines an Experimental Protocol for the Internet community.},

In most multiagent systems planning on forehand can help to seriously improve the efficiency of executing actions. The main difference between centrally creating a plan and constructing a plan for a system of agents lies in the fact that in the latter coordination plays the main part. This introduces a number of additional difficulties. This special issue discusses some of these difficulties in detail. To place these in a context, this introduction gives a brief overview of multiagent planning problems, and most multiagent planning techniques.

abstract = {The IEEE 802.15.4 radio standard features the possibility for IEEE 802.15.4 nodes to run on batteries for several years. This is made possible by duty-cycling medium access control (MAC) protocols, which allow IEEE 802.15.4 nodes to leave their radios in energy-saving sleep modes most of the time. Yet, duty-cycling MAC protocols usually incur long routing delays since it may take a while until a particular forwarder becomes available for forwarding a packet. Opportunistic routing alleviates this problem by opportunistically using a currently available forwarder, rather than waiting for a particular forwarder. Among all opportunistic routing schemes, so-called dynamic switch-based forwarding (DSF) schemes are most promising from a security and practical perspective, but some security and reliability issues with them persist. In this paper, we propose secure multipath opportunistic routing (SMOR), a DSF scheme that improves on current DSF schemes in three regards. First, SMOR builds on a denial-of-sleep-resilient MAC layer. Current DSF schemes, by comparison, rest on MAC protocols that put the limited energy reserves of battery-powered IEEE 802.15.4 nodes at risk. Second, SMOR operates in a distributed fashion and efficiently supports point-to-point traffic. All current DSF schemes, by contrast, suffer from a single point of failure and focus on convergecast traffic. Third, SMOR duplicates packets on purpose and routes them along disjoint paths. This makes SMOR tolerant of compromises of single IEEE 802.15.4 nodes, whereas current DSF schemes lack intrusion tolerance. We integrated SMOR into the network stack of the Contiki-NG operating system and benchmarked SMOR against the Routing Protocol for Low-Power and Lossy Networks (RPL) with the Cooja network simulator. Indeed, SMOR turns out to improve on RPL’s delays by between 33.51\% and 39.84\%, depending on the exact configurations and network dynamics. Furthermore, SMOR achieves between 0.16\% and 2.03\% higher mean packet delivery ratios (PDRs), thereby attaining mean PDRs of 99.999\% in all simulated scenarios. Beyond that, SMOR has only a fraction of RPL’s memory requirements. SMOR’s intrusion tolerance, on the other hand, increases the mean energy consumption per IEEE 802.15.4 node by between 1.55\% and 2.74\% compared to RPL in our simulations. SMOR specifically targets IEEE 802.15.4 networks with a network diameter of 2, such as body area networks.}

A technology that has been widely used in these contexts is the Wireless Smart Ubiquitous Networks Field Area Network (Wi-SUN FAN) standard, which defines the implementation and behavior of interoperable networks based on open standards such as IEEE 802.15.4 and the IPv6 Routing Protocol for Low-Power and Lossy Networks (RPL). The adopted standards allow Wi-SUN FAN networks to take advantage of features such as security, frequency hopping, multi-hop packet routing, and IPv6 addressing, ensuring a wide coverage area and immunity against electromagnetic interference. Despite all the advantages, a shortcoming of Wi-SUN FAN networks is the long network formation time. In this article, we propose a mechanism called Fast Routing Recovery (FRR), which aims to accelerate the reconnection process in networks that use the RPL protocol by memorizing information about the nodes’ preferred parents. We evaluate the FRR mechanism by simulations and experiments. The results indicate that FRR can reduce the network formation time by up to 50\% in certain network scenarios.}

The high level communication functionalities we offer include point-to-point communication, point-to-area communication, and one-to-all communication.

The optimal performance of the network, therefore, can only be achieved by joint routing and scheduling optimization. Although the joint single-path routing and scheduling optimization problem has been extensively studied, its multi-path counterpart within wireless mesh networks has not yet been fully investigated. In this paper, we present an optimization architecture for joint multi-path QoS routing and the underlying wireless link scheduling in wireless mesh networks. By employing the contention matrix to represent the wireless link interference, we formulate a utility maximization problem for the joint multi-path routing and MAC scheduling and resolve it using the primal–dual method. Since the multi-path routing usually results in the non-strict concavity of the primal objective function, we first introduce the Proximal Optimization Algorithm to get around such difficulty. We then propose an algorithm to solve the routing subproblem and the scheduling subproblem via the dual decomposition. Simulations demonstrate the efficiency and correctness of our algorithm.}

Due to the limited capacity of the wireless node, a multicast call may be dropped if there is no multicast tree formed within the given constraints. In this paper, we propose a new multicast tree construction algorithm which has maximum traffic flow and minimum delay under capacity constraints. The problem of multicast is formulated as a Linear Programming (LP) problem with associated constraints. A cost function (CF) is defined to choose the less loaded route among the available ones. A Minimum Delay Maximum Flow Multicast (MDMF) algorithm is proposed to solve this problem using CF and associated constraints. The performance of the proposed algorithm and CF is evaluated and compared with well-known algorithms with respect to packet delivery fraction, latency, and network throughput. The results obtained show that the proposed algorithm has a lesser number of transmissions for a given CF. Moreover, the proposed algorithm has high throughput, packet delivery fraction and less latency compared to other well-known algorithms in this category.}

abstract = {The Bluetooth Low Energy (BLE) mesh profile, standardized by the Bluetooth Special Interest Group (SIG), has an increasing interest in IoT solutions. However, the standard assumes that relay and friend nodes should be continuously scanning the channel awaiting any incoming transmissions. This could be very inefficient in terms of energy consumption, particularly in application scenarios where the backbone of the mesh network cannot be powered and traffic is infrequent. Hence, we present a novel strategy, named PSM-DMO, that minimizes the scan periods and thus, significantly reduces the overall energy consumption of the mesh network. PSM-DMO is defined as a new and optional feature for the currently published BLE mesh specifications, coexists with the standard operation, and is implemented without modifying the core of the specification. The proposal, that ensures the reliability of the mesh operation, can be used in BLE sensor networks that can tolerate a certain transmission delay. PSM-DMO replaces the continuous scan by a periodic but asynchronous polling process whereby the relay and sink nodes interrogate their neighbors about the existence of data to receive or to retransmit through the network. Nodes only go into scan mode during the period of time the mesh network will be involved in the transmission and dissemination. This period is estimated by the node which is the source of data, it is announced to its neighbors and it is propagated consecutively by all the relay nodes until the destination. PSM-DMO allows a theoretical reduction in the energy consumption of relay nodes up to 99.24\%.}

In sparsely connected searching scenarios or dense tracking scenarios, RGR may also slightly decrease delay compared to traditional reactive routing protocols for similar PDR.}

They have attributes such multi-hop wireless connectivity, continuously changing topology and easy deployment. The increasing demands that are made by users pose a challenge in the improvement of the quality of wireless ad-hoc networks. The performance of wireless ad-hoc networks depend on the efficiency of routing protocols, especially the routing metric operating within it. In this paper, the performance of the recently proposed routing metric Interference Bandwidth Adjusted Expected transmission count (IBETX) metric is compared with two prominent existing metrics, the Expected transmission count (ETX) and the Inverse Expected Transmission count (InvETX) over the Destination Sequenced Distance Vector (DSDV) routing protocol. The performance differentials are analysed using varying packet rates and node densities. From the simulations results, IBETX metric outperforms the ETX and InvETX metric because it implements the bandwidth sharing mechanism and makes use of the information available at the MAC layer. It can also be noted that it is very sensitive to data traffic rate. It performs well in low and medium node densities.}

This is achieved through fair maximum rate control of interfering nodes in inter and intra paths of hot spots.

The study of various routing protocols for sensor networks presents a classification for the various approaches pursued. The three main categories explored are data-centric, hierarchical and location-based. Each of the routing schemes and algorithms has the common objective of trying to get better throughput and to extend the lifetime of the sensor network.

abstract = {In this paper, we investigate flooding attack detection and prevention for smart meter networks. The default Ad hoc On-Demand Distance Vector (AODV) protocol is vulnerable to flooding attacks because intermediate meters forward packets blindly. To detect and prevent flooding attacks, we propose a new AODV-based routing protocol called FLOoding aWareness AODV (FLOW-AODV) considering both with and without Internet Protocol (IP) spoofing. If no IP spoofing exists, we modify the route request forwarding procedure by adding new features. The main idea is to enable one-hop neighboring meters to detect attackers by counting the received route requests from the same source. Specifically, when a meter receives a request, it first determines whether it is a one-hop neighbor to the source or not. If yes, the one-hop neighboring meter updates its request counter for every received request from that source. When the received requests exceed a predefined number (e.g., 2), it perceives the source as an attacker and just discards the following requests, so the flooding is avoided. In this way, the receiver can prevent flooding attacks when there is no IP spoofing from flooding attacker. If IP spoofing exists, the flooding attacker will hide its real IP address. In this case, we have extended our algorithm and included trustworthiness of each neighbor in the neighbor routing table. Extensive simulations are conducted in NS3 to evaluate the performance of FLOW-AODV. Results show that FLOW-AODV obtains considerably higher performance in terms of packet delivery ratio, and average delay compared with the default AODV routing protocol. In addition, the FLOW-AODV significantly improves network performance and eliminates congestion when multiple attackers are involved.}

abstract = {A Wireless Sensor Network (WSN) is a system of sensor nodes that communicate with one another and with their surroundings. Wireless sensor nodes are now used as the foundation for the higher-level industrial internet of things applications. Any type of real-time Internet of Things (IoT) application, as long as the data is collected utilizing the device's sensors. WSN are severely limited in terms of energy. Routing is one of the most challenging components of WSNs. Unbalanced energy utilization during data packet routing operations is one of the most serious difficulties with WSNs. This issue must be considered because the energy levels of sensor nodes are limited. We used WSNs multipath routing to save energy, improve scalability, and balance load. Many investigations are being undertaken to increase sensor node energy efficiency and network lifetime. More attention must be devoted to the clustering and routing components of communication in order to conserve energy. Clustering, also known as node clustering is a network organizing approach which helps with energy efficiency, workload distribution, data collection, and a connected hierarchy. The network is made up of numerous sensor nodes that must connect with one another in order for data to reach its goal, and when messages are not sent to intermediary nodes, problems arise. With multipath routing, numerous paths between the source and destination can be created, improving the possibility of data reaching the target and providing additional copies via alternate paths. The proposed routing solution uses less energy and extends the life of the network while compared with well-known approaches i.e., LEACH, ECPF, CHEF, UCR, DFLC, ACAWT, and Gupta. According to the simulation results and overall analysis, the proposed technique is much better than all the previous approaches under different number of nodes and simulation time in terms of end-to-end time reduced by 17.09\% to 68.13\%, energy consumption reduced by 13.23\% to 29.12\%, packet loss rate declined by 16.33\% to 82.38\% and drop rate of alive sensor nodes are much better shows high network resilience.}

Due to communication protocol complexity; rigidity; cost of commercial-off-the-shelf (COT) components; limited radio bandwidth; high mobility and computational resources; maintaining the desired level of Quality of Service (QoS) becomes a daunting task. For the first time in this research we propose multicluster FANETs for efficient network management; the proposed scheme considerably reduces communication cost and optimizes network performance as well as exploit low power; less complex and low cost IEEE 802.15.4 (MAC) protocol for intercluster and intracluster communication. In this research both beacon enabled mode and beaconless modes have been investigated with Guaranteed Time Slots (GTS) and virtual Time Division Multiple Access (TDMA) respectively. The methodology plays a key role towards reserving bandwidth for latency critical applications; eliminate collisions and medium access delays. Moreover analysis ad-hoc routing protocols including two proactive (OLSR, DSDV) and one reactive (AODV) is also presented. The results shows that the proposed scheme guarantees high packet delivery ratios while maintaining acceptable levels of latency requirements comparable with more complex and dedicatedly designed protocols in literature.}

From the perspective of communication and data collection, the success rate of collaborations between nodes in mobile ad hoc networks and reliability of data collection mainly depend on whether the nodes in the network operate normally, namely, according to the established network rules. However, mobile ad hoc networks are vulnerable to attacks targeting transmission channels and nodes owing to their dynamic evolution, openness, and distributed characteristics. Therefore, during the network operation, it is necessary to classify and detect the behavior and characteristics of each node. However, most existing research only analyzes and considers responses against a single or small number of attacks. To address these issues, this article first systematically analyzed and classified common active attacks in MANETs. Then, a node trust model was proposed based on the characteristics of various attacks; subsequently, a new secure routing protocol, namely, TC-AODV, was proposed. This protocol has minimal effect on the original communication dynamics and can effectively deal with Packet drop, wormhole, Session hijacking, and other main attacks in MANETs. The NS3 simulation results show that the proposed routing protocol attains good transmission performance, can effectively identify various attacks and bypass malicious nodes, and securely complete the communication process.}

              checklist was developed by a 24-member expert panel and 2 research
              leads following published guidance from the EQUATOR (Enhancing the
              QUAlity and Transparency Of health Research) Network. The final
              checklist contains 20 essential reporting items and 2 optional
              items. The authors provide a rationale and an example of good
              reporting for each item. The intent of the PRISMA-ScR is to help
              readers (including researchers, publishers, commissioners,
              policymakers, health care providers, guideline developers, and
              patients or consumers) develop a greater understanding of relevant
              terminology, core concepts, and key items to report for scoping
              reviews. },

  title = "Guidance for conducting systematic scoping reviews",
  abstract = "Reviews of primary research are becoming more common as
              evidence-based practice gains recognition as the benchmark for care
              , and the number of, and access to, primary research sources has
              grown. One of the newer review types is the 'scoping review'. In
              general, scoping reviews are commonly used for 'reconnaissance' -
              to clarify working definitions and conceptual boundaries of a topic
              or field. Scoping reviews are therefore particularly useful when a
              body of literature has not yet been comprehensively reviewed, or
              exhibits a complex or heterogeneous nature not amenable to a more
              precise systematic review of the evidence. While scoping reviews
              may be conducted to determine the value and probable scope of a
              full systematic review, they may also be undertaken as exercises in
              and of themselves to summarize and disseminate research findings,
              to identify research gaps, and to make recommendations for the
              future research. This article briefly introduces the reader to
              scoping reviews, how they are different to systematic reviews, and
              why they might be conducted. The methodology and guidance for the
              conduct of systematic scoping reviews outlined below was developed
              by members of the Joanna Briggs Institute and members of five
              Joanna Briggs Collaborating Centres.",
